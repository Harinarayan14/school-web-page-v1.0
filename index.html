        Anand Niketan School Mehsana focuses on the all-round development of a child. Some students are intellectually <br>
        bright and learn quickly from the academics provided and from the activities undergone. Our teachers mentor them towards <br>
        their bright career by helping them lay the extra stone in their solid foundation. Other students take their own sweet time <br>
        to achieve success.
    </p>
    <p>
        Success stories are the result of the integrated efforts of the school, the teachers, the students and the parents.<br>
         Our students succeed in innovation, academics, sports, theatre, dance, declamation, debate and many more.<br>
         The quantum of success is remarkable as per the age of every child in the school.
